An intelligent document analysis tool that helps you find answers from your PDF documents using semantic search and AI-powered question answering.

== What It Does

Upload your PDFs, ask questions in plain English, and get accurate answers pulled directly from your documents.  
The system understands *context and meaning*, not just keywords.

== Key Features

* *PDF Support* – Upload and process multiple PDF documents
* *Smart Search* – Finds relevant information using semantic understanding
* *Contextual Answers* – Generates responses based on actual document content
* *Conversation Tracking* – Keeps a history of your questions and answers
* *Flexible Settings* – Adjust processing parameters for optimal results
* *Clean Interface* – Simple, intuitive design built with Streamlit

== Tech Stack

* Python 3.12
* Streamlit (UI framework)
* LangChain (document processing & RAG)
* FAISS (vector similarity search)
* Sentence Transformers (text embeddings)
* *Google Gemini (Generative AI)* – for answer generation
* PyPDF (PDF text extraction)

== Requirements

* Python 3.12+
* *GEMINI_API_KEY* (Google Generative AI)
* 2GB+ RAM (recommended)

== Setup Instructions

=== 1. Clone this repository
[source,bash]
----
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ai-document-assistant
----

=== 2. Create a virtual environment
[source,bash]
----
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
----

=== 3. Install dependencies
[source,bash]
----
pip install -r requirements.txt
----

=== 4. Add your Gemini API key
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
----
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
----

=== 5. Launch the app
[source,bash]
----
streamlit run app.py
----

Then open your browser to http://localhost:8501

== How to Use

. *Upload Documents* – Select your PDF files from the sidebar uploader
. *Configure Settings (Optional)* – Adjust chunk size and overlap
. *Process* – Click *Process Documents* to analyze your PDFs
. *Ask Questions* – Type a question and press Enter
. *Review Answers* – See AI-generated responses sourced from your documents

== How It Works

The system uses *Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)*:

. *Text Extraction* – Extracts text from PDFs
. *Chunking* – Splits text into overlapping sections
. *Embedding* – Converts chunks into numerical vectors
. *Indexing* – Stores vectors in a FAISS index for fast search
. *Retrieval* – Finds relevant chunks for your query
. *Generation* – Sends retrieved context to Gemini to generate answers

== Configuration Options

[cols="1,2,1", options="header"]
|===
| Setting | Description | Default
| Chunk Size | Characters per text chunk | 1000
| Chunk Overlap | Overlap between chunks | 200
|===

TIP: Larger chunks = more context but slower processing.  
Smaller chunks = faster but may lose coherence.

== Development

=== Install dev dependencies
[source,bash]
----
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
----

=== Run tests
[source,bash]
----
pytest
----

=== Format and lint
[source,bash]
----
black .
flake8 .
----

=== Test Overview

|===
| Test File | Purpose
| test_app.py | Streamlit app and session state logic
| test_rag.py | RAG logic and Gemini integration
| test_vector_store.py | FAISS and embeddings
| test_document_processor.py | PDF loading and chunking
| conftest.py | Shared test fixtures
|===

== CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses *GitHub Actions* for automated testing and linting.  
Each commit triggers a pipeline that runs `pytest`, `flake8`, and `black` checks.

== Troubleshooting

*“File path <MagicMock> is not a valid file or URL”* +
→ Occurs only in tests — ensure mocks and fixtures are active.

*Slow processing* +
→ Reduce chunk size or upload fewer documents.

*Gemini API errors* +
→ Confirm your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is valid and active in your Google Cloud project.
